This smartphone is part of
the sixth generation of the Moto G family.
The product is unique mainly due to
its originality and eye-catching appearance.
The architecture of the phone adapts to
better-holding hands because of
the curved glass at the sides.
A backside gives the impression of 3D glass.
Below the screen is located a fingerprint reader which
offers many functions besides that.
The display has a good balance between
the colours and contrast.
But most of all, it boasts a dual camera.
One is the main and has 12MP.
The second one specifies depth detection with 5MP.  
If you are interested in this product,
you can read more about it on this page.

The Motorola brand offers a lot for little money, but the elements<br /> of the flagships are more favourable price though I like this brand. Overall, Motorola is system is fast without<br /> unnecessary superstructures with pure Android from Google. Motorola adds only one thing - Moto Gestures which are<br /> very addictive and surprisingly I get used to them quickly. No other brand has such gestures. Gestures such as<br /> shaking the sides turn on the flashlight or turning the phone to switch on the camera. Everything works without<br /> turning on the phone. There are many gestures, but only these are my favourites. The bottom bar has a fast<br /> fingerprint scanner that works as well as multifunctional phone control, which is a handy thing';
